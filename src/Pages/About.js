            About
            I am a former EMT and currently a Title Examiner for Fidelity National
            Financial. I'm also a student at the UW for Full Stack Web
            Development. My goal is to someday work in AI, or in
            blockchain technology, Cybersecurity. However, I would be just as happy working for a church creating their
            apps or an intricate webpage for the congregation to use in scheduling
            volunteers, child care, services, conferences and worship team
            schedules.
